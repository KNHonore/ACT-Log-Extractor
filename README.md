## Exporting as text vs. HTML

* When exporting the log as HTML the players will be color coded for easier reading. 

* When exporting as as text, the conversations are simply exported as plaintext.

# Known issues

* Some in-game links aren't filtered properly (ex. map coordinates, achievements).
* "Add blank lines to indicate breaks in conversation" is not yet implemented.
* The application currently assumes you're using the default directory for log files.
